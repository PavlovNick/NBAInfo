            <p class="card-text">The NBA began its life as the Basketball Association of America in 1946. Then there were 11 teams, and today the league has 30, including teams known not only to basketball fans: the Boston Celtics, Chicago Bulls, Los Angeles Lakers and other famous clubs. The association is the leading men's professional basketball league and one of the four major professional sports leagues in the USA and Canada. NBA players are some of the highest paid athletes in the world.</p>

            <h4 class="card-title">National Basketball Association</h4>

            <p class="card-text">To begin with, in 1891, James Naismith invented a game like basketball. A native of Canada, but living in America, he taught physical education in college. Classes in the hall were monotonous and boring. Then James hung around the edges of the basket, where he suggested throwing balls. News of the game began to spread throughout the country, and local basketball teams soon appeared. Following them, leagues formed. They appeared and disappeared one after another. But two stood out: the National Basketball League (NBL), founded in 1937, and the Basketball Association of America (BAA).</p>

                  <img src="img/history1.jpg" class="img-fluid">
                  <div class="mask flex-center"></div>
                </div>
              </div>
            </div>    



            <p class="card-text"><em>James Naismith</em></p>

            <p class="card-text">BAA appeared 9 years after the NBL. She established herself in big cities and became a direct competitor to the national league, which held games in schools. The fact is that the association had behind itself large sponsors in the person of the founders - owners of large hockey arenas and Maurice Podolof, who was at the helm. In fact, the NBL had the best players, and the BAA had the money and the opportunity to play in stadiums. This was the impetus for the unification.</p>

            <p class="card-text">When the two leagues merged in 1949, the total number of teams reached 16, and the name was transformed into the National Basketball Association. However, in the 1950s the number of teams decreased along with the support of the fans, and by the season of 1954-55 there were only eight. In the same year, the league created a 24-second rule, making the game more dynamic and interesting. Fans returned and the league, now financially solvent, expanded. Today, the NBA has 30 teams and attracts players and millions of fans from around the world.</p>

            <h4 class="card-title">NBA draft</h4>

            <p class="card-text">The most important event in basketball is the selection of a new young player. Often these are college students who are over 19 years old. Until 2006, there was no clear age limit. The rule itself was invented in 1947 to prevent wars for the athlete. Today, the draft has two rounds.</p>

            <p class="card-text">First come the teams with the lowest rating, not in the playoffs. Using the lottery, the order of choice of players is distributed. The worst team has the best odds - 250 combinations. All basketball players who have graduated from school are eligible to apply for participation in the draft.</p>

            <p class="card-text">The 1984 draft is still considered the most popular draft when Hakim Olajuvon, Michael Jordan, Charles Barkley, Alvin Robertson, and John Stockton made it to the NBA. The 1996 selection was held by Allen Iverson, Ray Allen, Kobe Bryant and Steve Nash. The best draft of the new millennium is the 2003 lottery, when LeBron James, Dwayne Wade, Carmelo Anthony and Chris Bosch appeared.</p>

            <h4 class="card-title">NBA Stars</h4>

            <p class="card-text">Every year, the National Basketball Association gives 12 awards to the best players, coaches and managers. There is a national team of all NBA stars, which is compiled on the basis of each season. Karim Abdul-Jabbar, Kobe Bryant and Tim Duncan entered it 15 times, and Karl Malone and Shaquille Oâ€™Neill - 14 times. The 2017/18 season included Kevin Durant, LeBron James, Demar Derosan, Jimmy Butler. A total of 15 players are selected.</p>

            <p class="card-text">There is an unshakable list of the top 50 basketball players of all time. They were selected in 1996 in honor of the 50th anniversary of the NBA.</p>

            <p class="card-text">At that time, 11 players from the list played: Charles Barkley, Clyde Drexler, Patrick Ewing, Michael Jordan, Karl Malone, Shaquille Oâ€™Neill, Hakim Oladzhuvon, Robert Parish, Scotty Pippen, David Robinson and John Stockton. Ranked among the best Pete Maravich died in 1988 from heart failure. Also on the list are Karim Abdul-Jabbar, Bob Cousey and Nate Termond.</p>

            <h4 class="card-title">Ball nba</h4>

            <p class="card-text">Traditionally, a basketball has a brown hue, eight inserts and black seams. There are 4 ball sizes, depending on the type of competition. Weight varies from 567 to 650 grams. The official sponsor of the National Basketball Association, supplying balls, is the American company Spalding. Founded in 1876, it made its first ball at the end of the 19th century in honor of basketball maker James Naismith. Since 1983, the brand has been creating balls for the NBA, including the Women's National Basketball Association. The brand's ambassador was Paul Pierce. Recently, a collection of balls with Kobe Bryant has been released. The brand has also collaborated with BAPE and Supreme.</p>
